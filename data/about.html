        <h2>1 - Game Components</h2>
        <p>Journey Through Europe is a travel game of strategy and planning for all the family. It can be played by 2 to 6 players and it contains:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 playing board,</li>
            <li>6 playing pieces</li>
            <li>6 flags in different colors</li>
            <li>180 place cards (64 with illustrations and special instructions)</li>
            <li>6 flight plans</li>
            <li> 1 dice</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2 - Game Description</h2>

        <p>The players go on a journey through Europe. Cards are handed out which determine an ever­changing route, different for each player. 
            The idea is to use skill and careful consideration to choose the best route in order to be first home. </p>

        <h3>2.1 Preparation:</h3> 
            <ul>
                <li>The user can select to play a new game or load the last saved game (a game can be saved by a user at any time in playing the game during the user’s turn).</li>
                <li>If the user selects to start a new game, then the user selects the number of players, the name of each player and the type: computer or user.</li>
                <li>Each player receives a playing piece, a flag of the same color and a flight plan.</li>
                <li>The place cards are sorted into three piles according to the color at the top of the card.</li>
                <li>The players now receive their first place card; these are dealt as follows: the first player receives a red one, the second green, the next yellow, the next red and so on.</li>
                <li>The city shown on a player's first card is both beginning and end of his/her journey.</li>
                <li>The game starts with the flags next to these cities on the board.</li>
                <li>Now each player receives two more cards (there are eight more cards dealt in the real game, but we have to test it with less – implement an easy programming setup to change the number of cards dealt to eight). These are dealt so that each player has a total of one card in each color. They indicate the cities to be visited on the journey through Europe. To make it easier to find these cities, each card is marked with a letter and a number which correspond to the grid marked around the edges of the board. Some place cards are illustrated, featuring tourist attractions. These cards also have special instructions on the reverse. A further educational aspect of the game is that the place cards are marked on the front with the town and city names in the native language of their country. The English name appears on the back of the cards.</li>
                <li>Players should look at all of their cards at the beginning of the game, take note of any instructions and thereby plan the quickest and most suitable route.</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>2.2 Play</h3> 
            <ul>
                <li>Players throw the die in turn.</li>
                <li>The number thrown indicates the number of cities through which the player advances.</li>
                <li>If he lands on or passes through a city for which he holds a place card, he gives this card to the dealer.</li>
                <li>If a six is thrown, the player may take another turn.</li>
                <li>Players can travel in any direction, but not backwards and forwards in the same go.</li>
                <li>They can pass any flags or playing pieces, but only one playing piece can be in one city at any given time.</li>
                <li>If a player reaches a city for which he holds a card with special instructions, he must stop there, even if his throw means he could normally go further. The instructions must now be carried out.</li>
                <li>He then gives the place card to the dealer and the next person takes his turn.</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>2.3 End of Game</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The last card to be handed in is that for the city from which the journey started.</li>
            <li> The player who is first to achieve this is the winner. </li>
            <li>If, however, there are special instructions on the player's last card, he must carry them out first. This may mean that the player will have to leave this place again and that he will only win if he returns in time.</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>3 - Special Routes</h2>
        <h3>3.1 Sea Routes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The die is not thrown when a player crosses the sea, as he may only travel from one harbor to another.</li>
                <li>A player may not cross the sea as part of his go.</li>
                <li>He must wait at the harbor for his next turn; extra points are lost.</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>3.2 Air Routes</h3>
        <p>The journey can be speeded up a lot by cleverly planned flights. There are 35 air pons on the board, and all appear on the flight plans. They are marked on both board and flight plans with a red spot. If a player reaches a city with an airport and has points left to travel, the journey can be continued by plane. This is where the flight plan comes into play. The flight plan is divided into six sectors. A flight to any airport city in the same sector requires two dice points. Four points are required to cross over into an adjoining sector. A player may only move vertically or horizontally when flying into another sector, not diagonally. If a player is at an airport and scores too few points to fly to his desired destination, he may not remain at the airport. He must move on, either by land or air, by the number he has thrown. If a player has dice points left after his plane journey he must move on from his place of arrival. A player may fly only once during his turn. The airport he wishes to reach must be unoccupied, i.e. no other player's playing piece must be sitting there. If the airport is occupied, the player must either continue to travel by land or choose another airport to go to. All airport cities have special instructions. If a player holds a card for an airport city the special instructions on this card take priority over any intentions to fly from there.</p>
